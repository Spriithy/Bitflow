# Bitflow
The bitflow programming language


## Coding in Bitflow

### Getting started

First, when coding in Bitflow you should always keep in mind you are not using any serious programming language. This is a language mostly designed within 4 hours as a challenge.

If you still want to play with it, go ahead !

You will need a Python3 installation in order to interprete your Bitflow code. After getting all that working, you can start coding !

### New Program

Every Bitflow program must be contained in a `.bitflow` file. If not, the interpreter will abort the process.
Once you have your file setup, type the base program.

```txt
(a,b):{
  ... code here ...
};
```

Again, this is the base code without what the Bitflow interpreter can work. Between the two curly brackets, you can type your code !

### How it works

Basically, Bitflow lets you manipulate an array of 10 integers indexed from 0 to 9 (obviously). And that's all ! You can't manipulate specific type variables or anything ! Only integers ! But that said, you can still work with ASCII characters by printing them out. But we'll speak about that later on.

First things first, to be able to work with a given index of the array, you must specify it this way :

```txt
@<index>: ...
```

Where `<index>` is in range 0, 9 inclusive. When you have this, you can now jump to the next part !

### Knowing the useful things

The Bitflow programming language is a charcter-based language. This means, this language doesn't work with natural words. This said, I know let you discover the list of the 11 useful characters :

* `#` as in python let's you begin a comment

* `+`  lets you increment the current index by one
* `-`  lets you decrement the current index by one
* `*`  lets you  multiply the current index by two
* `/`  lets you   divide  the current index by two
* `^`  lets you set the current index under power two

* `!`  lets you set the current index value to 0
* `&`  lets you set the current index value to 64
* `$`  lets you set the current index value to 96

* `.`  lets you print the current value as is (Integer)
* `,`  lets you print the current value as an ASCII-character
* `_`  prints a whitespace
* `;`  is equivalent to `\n`

Now let's have a look a working example !

### Adding comments

If you ever want to write comments in your program, just add some at the **end of a line** (or single one).

```txt
@0:
  +++.   # This is a comment and this instructions should print ‘3’
```

#### Example

This example will simply compute and display some numbers on the screen

```txt
(a,b):{
  @0:
    +*^.;             # Should print ‘4’ on a single line
  @1:
    -*/.;             # This logicaly prints ‘-1’
};
```

A basic `Hello World !` program should be (most intuitive version)

```txt
(a,b):{
  @0:                     // We're working with index 0
    &                     // Let's set the value to be 64 (ascii caps letters)
      ++++++++,           // And go to ‘H’
    $                     // Let's go to non caps letters !
      +++++,,             // Go to ‘e’ and print it out !
      +++++++,,
      +++,
    _       // This prints a whitespace
    $
      ---------,
    $
      +++++++++++++++,
      +++,
      ------,
    $
      ++++,
    &/+,   // And this prints an exclamating point
};
```

### Let's go deeper !

Now that you know the basics of Bitflow, let me introduce you to loops ! The loops implemented in Bitflow are extremenly easy to understand ! They are forking like common `for` loops, without specifying neither variable as counter nor incrementation rule.

A Bitflow loop should look like this :

```txt
{<limit>:<code>}
```

Where :

* `<limit>` is the number of iteration of the loop. You can specify it like a normal calculus, i.e. using `+` or `-` or whatever !
* `<code>` is the code you want to apply to the current index

Let's see an example :

```txt
@0:            // Let's work in index 0
  ! {&:+.;}    // Yay ...
```

Let's see... This code will loop 64 times and will display each value on a single line !

### And even deeper !

Now you know how to implement a loop, let's see how to implement nested loops ! Bitflow doesn't natively support nested loops and this is why you can use the **deep-loop**. A deep-loop is a loop **inside** another loop. It is delimited by `[]` rather than `{}`. You can only use this loop inside another loop. Let's see how it works using the example of the multiplication.

```txt
@0:              // again, index 0...
  {&: [&:+] }.;  // hehe !
```

This simple code computes `& * &` that is to say `64 * 64 = 4096`. Of course, you can use several different nested loops side by side ! For example, `{$: [&: +] [$: -] }` is correct and working code that outputs `-3072`.

Let's rewrite the `HelloWorld` program using loops !

```txt
(a,b):{
  @0:
    &/++++*,
    /{++:+++++++}*+,
    +++++++,,
    +++,
    _
    &/{+++:++++}*-,
    ${+++:+++++},
    +++,
    {++:---},
    $++++,
    _&/+,
}
```

### Reffering to other indexes values

Of course you can refer to existing index values ! You can do it extremely easily by typing the index of the array index you want to set !

```txt
@0:&^
@1:0.;
```

This code will output the value of index `0`.

### Using command line arguments

Have you ever wondered what did `a` and `b` stand for ? Well, they represent the different values you can pass to the program when compiling it. If not specified, those values are considered null (0). You can use them by typing either `a` or `b` in your code. Those values can be used as loop iteration limit.

You are now ready for Bitflow !
